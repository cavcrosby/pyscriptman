1. In cmd.py, we can separate each subcommand into its own class. The 'file' itself would be the root parser, each action would be a first level parser, and each host would be a second level parser.
    - Each root and first level parsers would have subparsers action object (container) that contained parsers once level down (root subparsers would be first level subparsers, first subparsers would be second level subparsers)
    - At the moment, first and second level subparsers would rely more so on instance methods (there will be multiple first/second level parsers) 
    - This hierarchy could extend into a n-tier hierarchy, GitHub might need subparsers to help determine if pulling own repos or another user's repo(s)
2. Logging might need to be a component that is added on to exception handling.
3. Verbose mode can be added for output generated by different parts of the code.
4. Init process when installing application.
